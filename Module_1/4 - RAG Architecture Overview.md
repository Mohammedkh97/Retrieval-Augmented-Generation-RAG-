### 🧠 Core Components of a RAG System

1. **Large Language Model (LLM)**  
   - The generative engine that produces responses based on input prompts.
   - Operates similarly to traditional LLMs when viewed from the user’s perspective.

2. **Retriever**  
   - Searches a **knowledge base** (e.g., document database) for relevant information.
   - Filters and returns the most pertinent documents based on the user’s query.

3. **Knowledge Base**  
   - A structured repository of domain-specific or proprietary documents.
   - Can be updated independently of the LLM, allowing dynamic content refresh.

---

### 🔄 How the Architecture Works

- **Step 1:** User submits a prompt (e.g., “Why are hotels in Vancouver expensive this weekend?”).
- **Step 2:** The prompt is routed to the **retriever**, which queries the knowledge base.
- **Step 3:** The system builds an **augmented prompt** by combining the original query with retrieved documents.
- **Step 4:** The augmented prompt is sent to the **LLM**, which generates a grounded response.

> Example Augmented Prompt:  
> “Answer the following question: Why are hotels in Vancouver expensive this weekend?  
> Here are five relevant articles that may help you respond…”

### ✅ Advantages of RAG Architecture

- **Improved Accuracy & Context Awareness**  
  - Combines LLM’s training knowledge with real-time, retrieved data.
  - Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual documents.

- **Up-to-Date Information**  
  - No need to retrain the LLM—just update the knowledge base.
  - Ideal for fast-changing domains like news, pricing, or policy.

- **Source Attribution**  
  - Retrieved documents can include citations.
  - Enables traceability and validation of generated content.

- **Modular Design**  
  - Each component (retriever, LLM, knowledge base) can be optimized independently.
  - Promotes scalability and maintainability.

### 🧪 Code Demo (Simplified)

Zain walks through a basic implementation:
- `retrieve(query)` → returns relevant documents.
- `generate(prompt)` → returns LLM-generated response.
- Augmented prompt = original query + retrieved context.

This demo illustrates how RAG systems can be built with just two functions, abstracting away complexity while retaining power.


#### 🧑‍💻 Code Walkthrough — Ideal RAG System

##### 🔹 Step 1: Define Core Functions

```python
def retrieve(query):
    # Wrapper around retriever
    # Accepts user query and returns relevant documents from the knowledge base
    return retrieved_docs
```

```python
def generate(prompt):
    # Wrapper around the LLM
    # Accepts a prompt and returns the model's response
    return llm_response
```

These two functions represent the **modular architecture** of RAG:
- `retrieve()` handles **fact-finding**.
- `generate()` handles **text generation**.

---

##### 🔹 Step 2: Submit a Raw Prompt

```python
prompt = "Why are hotel prices in Vancouver super expensive this weekend?"
response = generate(prompt)
```

This simulates a standard LLM interaction—without retrieval. The response may be generic or hallucinated.

---

##### 🔹 Step 3: Retrieve Contextual Information

```python
retrieved_docs = retrieve(prompt)
```

This step fetches relevant documents from the knowledge base—e.g., news articles about a concert or local events.

---

##### 🔹 Step 4: Build the Augmented Prompt

```python
augmented_prompt = f"""
Respond to the following prompt:
{prompt}

Use the following information retrieved to help you answer:
{retrieved_docs}
"""
```

This is the **ideal RAG pattern**:  
- Combine the original query with retrieved context.
- Structure the prompt clearly so the LLM knows what to do.

---

##### 🔹 Step 5: Generate the Final Response

```python
final_response = generate(augmented_prompt)
```

This response is now:
- **Grounded** in real data.
- **Accurate** and **context-aware**.
- Less likely to hallucinate.

---

#### ✅ Why This Is Ideal

- **Separation of concerns**: Retriever and LLM each do what they’re best at.
- **Scalability**: You can swap out retrievers or LLMs independently.
- **Maintainability**: Updating the knowledge base doesn’t require retraining the LLM.
- **Transparency**: Retrieved documents can be cited or logged for validation.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture of RAG

This is the conceptual overview of how a RAG system operates:

### 🔹 Components:
1. **User Prompt** – The initial query submitted by the user.
2. **Retriever** – Searches a knowledge base for relevant documents.
3. **Knowledge Base** – A database of domain-specific or proprietary information.
4. **Augmented Prompt Builder** – Combines the original prompt with retrieved documents.
5. **LLM (Large Language Model)** – Generates a response using the augmented prompt.

### 🔄 Flow:
```text
User Prompt → Retriever → Retrieved Docs → Augmented Prompt → LLM → Final Response
```

### ✅ Benefits:
- Modular and scalable.
- Keeps LLM responses grounded and up-to-date.
- Allows citation and traceability.
- Reduces hallucinations.

## 🧪 Simple Architecture (Code-Level Demo)

Zain simplifies the RAG system into two core functions:

```python
def retrieve(query):
    # Searches the knowledge base and returns relevant documents
    return retrieved_docs

def generate(prompt):
    # Sends the prompt to the LLM and returns the generated response
    return llm_response
```

### Example Flow:
```python
prompt = "Why are hotel prices in Vancouver expensive this weekend?"
retrieved_docs = retrieve(prompt)

augmented_prompt = f"""
Respond to the following prompt:
{prompt}

Use the following information retrieved to help you answer:
{retrieved_docs}
"""

final_response = generate(augmented_prompt)
```

### 🧠 Insight:
This simple architecture abstracts away the complexity but retains the core logic:
- Retrieval first.
- Prompt augmentation.
- Generation second.

| Simple Architecture     | Minimal code demo showing how RAG works with two functions                |

Both are valid representations—one for strategic system design, the other for quick prototyping.



### 🧭 Final Takeaway

> “RAG is about adding context to your prompt to help an LLM respond more accurately.” — Zain Hassan

The architecture is deceptively simple but unlocks powerful capabilities by combining retrieval and generation in a seamless pipeline.
