### 🧠 What Is an LLM?

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are neural networks trained to predict the next word (or token) in a sequence of text.
- They operate like **advanced autocomplete engines**, generating text one token at a time based on probabilities.

---

### 🔍 How LLMs Generate Text

1. **Prompt → Completion**  
   - The user provides a prompt (e.g., “What a beautiful day, the sun is…”).
   - The LLM predicts the next word: “shining,” “rising,” or even “exploding” (though improbable).

2. **Tokenization**  
   - LLMs don’t generate full words—they generate **tokens**.
   - Tokens can be full words (e.g., “London”) or parts of words (e.g., “un-” + “happy”).

3. **Probability Distribution**  
   - For each token, the LLM calculates the probability of it being the next in sequence.
   - It then **samples** from this distribution—introducing randomness and variation.

4. **Autoregressive Behavior**  
   - Each generated token influences the next.
   - Once a direction is chosen (e.g., “shining”), the model continues coherently (e.g., “in the sky”).

## 🧠 How LLMs Learn

### 🔹 Training Process

- LLMs are trained on **trillions of tokens** from massive text corpora—mostly from the open internet.
- It adjusts billions of internal parameters to improve accuracy.
- The model starts as a **neural network with billions of parameters** (weights), which initially produces gibberish.
- During training:
  - The model is shown **incomplete pieces of text**.
  - It tries to **predict the next token** (word or subword).
  - Based on how accurate its prediction is, it **updates its internal parameters** using backpropagation.
- Over time, the model learns:
  - **Statistical patterns** in language.
  - **Semantic relationships** between words.
  - **Stylistic nuances** across domains (e.g., legal, poetic, technical).

> “The model learns to produce both the factual information and the linguistic styles in the training data.” — Zain Hassan

## ⚠️ Why LLMs Hallucinate

- **Hallucinations**: LLMs may generate plausible-sounding but false information.
- **No access to private or real-time data**: They can’t answer questions about today’s news or internal company documents unless explicitly given that context.

### 🔹 Root Cause
- LLMs generate text based on **probability**, not **truth**.
- They don’t “know” facts—they **predict likely word sequences** based on training patterns.

### 🔹 When Hallucinations Occur
- If you ask about:
  - **Private/internal data** (e.g., your company’s docs)
  - **Recent events** (e.g., today’s news)
- The model likely wasn’t trained on that info.
- It will still try to respond—by **guessing** based on similar patterns it has seen.

### 🔹 Nature of Hallucination
- The response may sound fluent and plausible.
- But it could be **factually incorrect** or **entirely fabricated**.
- This isn’t a malfunction—it’s a design limitation.

> “LLMs generate probable text, not necessarily truthful text.” — Zain Hassan
> “Truth, as far as an LLM is concerned, is just that a sequence of words is probabilistically likely.”

### 🧠 Why RAG Complements LLMs

- RAG systems **ground** LLM responses by injecting relevant external information into the prompt.
- This helps align the model’s probabilistic output with factual truth.

### 🧭 How RAG Solves This

- RAG systems **inject relevant, retrieved information** into the prompt.
- This **grounds** the LLM’s response in factual context—even if that context wasn’t part of the training data.
- It aligns the model’s probabilistic output with **real-world truth**.

---

### ⚙️ Practical Constraints

- **Context Window**: LLMs have a limit on how much text they can process at once.
  - Older models: ~2,000–4,000 tokens.
  - Newer models: Up to millions.
- **Computational Cost**: Longer prompts increase processing time and resource usage.

---

### 🧪 Course Implementation

- The course uses **Together AI** to host open-source LLMs.
- This allows learners to experiment with model internals and prompt engineering.

---

### 🧭 Final Takeaway

LLMs are powerful tools for generating text, but they need help to stay accurate and relevant. RAG systems provide that help by retrieving and injecting context—making LLMs not just fluent, but informed.
