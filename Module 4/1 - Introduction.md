# 📘 Module 4 — Introduction: LLMs and Text Generation  
**Instructor:** Zain Hassan  
**Video Duration:** ~1 minute  
**Module Theme:** How to use and optimize LLMs in a RAG system

---

## 🧠 1. Transition from Retriever to Generator

> “The Retriever is a critical part of your RAG system, but the LLM is the real brains of the operation.”

- The retriever **finds and prepares** relevant information.
- But it’s the **LLM** that must:
  - Interpret that information
  - Generate a **high-quality, grounded response**

---

## 🎯 2. What You’ll Learn in Module 4

- **How LLMs work** under the hood
- **Transformer architecture** (the foundation of modern LLMs)
- How to **construct LLM calls in code**
- How to **iteratively improve** LLM outputs
- Techniques to ensure LLMs:
  - Stay **grounded** in retrieved context
  - Avoid hallucinations
  - Deliver **relevant, accurate answers**

---

## 🧪 3. Hands-On Focus

- You’ll get to:
  - Explore LLM capabilities
  - Practice **prompt engineering**
  - Handle **hallucinations**
  - Evaluate LLM performance
  - Build a **RAG-based chatbot** in the final assignment

> “You’ll see some advanced techniques that push the limits of LLM performance, but also get practical advice for what approaches tend to work for a typical RAG project.”

## 🚀 4. What’s Next

- The next video dives into the **transformer architecture**.
- This will give you the foundation to understand how LLMs process and generate text.
