## 🧭 1. Transition from Theory to Production

- “Now that you have a strong foundation in information retrieval, it's time to move all of that theory into production.”
- You’ve learned retrieval techniques — now you’ll apply them in **real-world systems**.

---

## 🗄️ 2. Traditional Databases vs Scale

- You *could* use a **relational database** to implement most of the retrieval techniques from Module 2.
- But when scaling to **millions or billions of documents**, performance drops — especially for **vector operations** used in semantic search.

> “Some of those operations, in particular the vector operations underlying semantic search, will slow down significantly.”

---

## 🧠 3. Why Vector Databases?

- At scale, you’ll want to switch to a **vector database**.
- These are **optimized to store and search** massive quantities of **vector data**.
- They’ve become **almost synonymous** with RAG systems.

> “Vector databases are databases optimized to store and search through huge quantities of vector data.”

## 🔍 4. What You’ll Learn in This Module

- Why vector databases are **so optimized** for vector retrieval.
- How to use one to execute **a variety of different searches**.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Production Techniques You’ll Explore

- **Document chunking**  
- **Query parsing**  
- **Reranking**

These are **production-grade techniques** used to **improve retriever performance** in real-world RAG systems.

> “You'll also see a collection of techniques used in production RAG systems, like document chunking, query parsing, and re-ranking.”

---

## 🧪 6. Hands-On Assignment

- You’ll complete a **programming assignment** at the end of the module.
- It will help you **apply all these concepts** in practice.

---

## 🎯 7. Final Encouragement

- “I hope you enjoy this module, where you'll get to apply all of your information retrieval knowledge.”
- “Join me in the next video and let's get started.”
